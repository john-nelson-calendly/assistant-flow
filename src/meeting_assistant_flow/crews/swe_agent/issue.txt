Background: This repo is a sample CrewAI flow that is for a Meeting Assistant.
I don't want a meeting assistant.  I want a Personal Assistant.

Objective: Please rename/refactor all references to meeting assistant and replace with personal assistant
This will not be an exact match.  Please search case insensitive

For example... 

    @start()
    def load_meeting_notes(self):
        print("Loading Meeting Notes")
        print("Current working directory:", os.getcwd())

        with open("meeting_notes.txt", "r") as file:
            self.state.transcript = file.read()

    @listen(load_meeting_notes)
    def generate_tasks_from_meeting_transcript(self):
        print("Kickoff the Meeting Assistant Crew")
        output = (
            MeetingAssistantCrew()
            .crew()
            .kickoff(inputs={"transcript": self.state.transcript})
        )

        tasks = output["tasks"]
        print("TASKS:", tasks)
        self.state.tasks = tasks

would turn into...

    @start()
    def load_personal_notes(self):
        print("Loading Personal Notes")
        print("Current working directory:", os.getcwd())

        with open("personal_notes.txt", "r") as file:
            self.state.transcript = file.read()

    @listen(load_personal_notes)
    def generate_tasks_from_personal_notes(self):
        print("Kickoff the Personal Assistant Crew")
        output = (
            PersonalAssistantCrew()
            .crew()
            .kickoff(inputs={"transcript": self.state.transcript})
        )

        tasks = output["tasks"]
        print("TASKS:", tasks)
        self.state.tasks = tasks
